Below is a comprehensive README.md file for your GitHub repository, tailored for the banking API project. It provides an overview of the project, details the database structure, lists all endpoints, and includes setup instructions, testing information, and contribution guidelines. The content is structured to be clear, professional, and under 3500 words for brevity while covering all necessary details.
Banking API
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
License
A secure and scalable RESTful banking API built with Spring Boot, providing account summary and transaction management functionalities. The API supports operations like deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and account queries, backed by a MySQL database with automated tests for reliability.

Project Overview
The Banking API is designed to manage banking operations, allowing users to retrieve account summaries and perform transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. It uses Spring Boot for the backend, MySQL for data storage, and includes comprehensive test scripts to ensure functionality. The project is ideal for developers seeking a robust banking application template.
Features

    Retrieve account summaries by account ID or customer ID.
    Perform transactions: deposits, withdrawals, and account-to-account transfers.
    Query transactions by ID, account, or date range.
    Input validation and error handling for secure operations.
    Automated bash test scripts for both account summary and transaction endpoints.
    MySQL database with views and stored procedures for optimized queries.

Technologies

    Java: 17
    Spring Boot: 3.3.4 (with Spring Data JPA, Spring Web, Spring Validation)
    MySQL: 8.3.0
    Maven: Dependency management
    Bash: Test scripts (test_transactions_api.sh, test_account_summary_api.sh)
    Lombok: Boilerplate reduction
    HikariCP: Connection pooling
    Hibernate: ORM for database interactions

Database Structure
The database (banking_db) consists of four tables and one view, designed to store account, customer, branch, and transaction data. A stored procedure handles transfers.
Tables

    accounts
    sql

    CREATE TABLE accounts (
        account_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        account_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
        account_type ENUM('SAVINGS', 'CHECKING') NOT NULL,
        balance DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00,
        customer_id INT NOT NULL,
        branch_id INT NOT NULL,
        FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
        FOREIGN KEY (branch_id) REFERENCES branches(branch_id)
    );

        Stores account details with balances and references to customers and branches.
    customers
    sql

    CREATE TABLE customers (
        customer_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
        phone VARCHAR(20)
    );

        Stores customer information.
    branches
    sql

    CREATE TABLE branches (
        branch_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        branch_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
        branch_address VARCHAR(255)
    );

        Stores branch details.
    transactions
    sql

    CREATE TABLE transactions (
        transaction_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        account_id INT NOT NULL,
        transaction_type ENUM('DEPOSIT', 'WITHDRAWAL', 'TRANSFER') NOT NULL,
        amount DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
        transaction_date DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
        description VARCHAR(255),
        target_account_id INT,
        FOREIGN KEY (account_id) REFERENCES accounts(account_id),
        FOREIGN KEY (target_account_id) REFERENCES accounts(account_id)
    );

        Stores transaction records, including transfers with a target account.

View

    account_summary
    sql

    CREATE VIEW account_summary AS
    SELECT 
        a.account_id,
        a.account_number,
        a.account_type,
        a.balance,
        a.customer_id,
        c.first_name,
        c.last_name,
        b.branch_name
    FROM 
        accounts a
        INNER JOIN customers c ON a.customer_id = c.customer_id
        INNER JOIN branches b ON a.branch_id = b.branch_id;

        Aggregates account details with customer and branch information for efficient querying.

Stored Procedure

    transfer_money
    sql

    DELIMITER //
    CREATE PROCEDURE transfer_money(
        IN from_account_id INT,
        IN to_account_id INT,
        IN transfer_amount DECIMAL(15,2),
        IN description VARCHAR(255)
    )
    BEGIN
        DECLARE from_balance DECIMAL(15,2);
        START TRANSACTION;
        SELECT balance INTO from_balance 
        FROM accounts 
        WHERE account_id = from_account_id 
        FOR UPDATE;
        IF from_balance < transfer_amount THEN
            SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
            SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Insufficient balance for transfer';
        END IF;
        UPDATE accounts 
        SET balance = balance - transfer_amount 
        WHERE account_id = from_account_id;
        UPDATE accounts 
        SET balance = balance + transfer_amount 
        WHERE account_id = to_account_id;
        INSERT INTO transactions (account_id, transaction_type, amount, transaction_date, description, target_account_id)
        VALUES (from_account_id, 'TRANSFER', transfer_amount, NOW(), description, to_account_id);
        INSERT INTO transactions (account_id, transaction_type, amount, transaction_date, description, target_account_id)
        VALUES (to_account_id, 'TRANSFER', transfer_amount, NOW(), CONCAT('Received from account ', from_account_id), from_account_id);
        COMMIT;
    END //
    DELIMITER ;

        Handles atomic transfers with balance checks and dual transaction logging.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

    Java 17
    Maven 3.8+
    MySQL 8.3.0
    Bash (for test scripts)

Steps

    Clone the Repository
    bash

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/banking-api.git
    cd banking-api

    Configure MySQL
        Create the database:
        bash

        mysql -u root -p
        CREATE DATABASE banking_db;

        Set up credentials in ~/.my.cnf:
        ini

        [client]
        user=testing
        password=heilschindler
        database=banking_db

        bash

        chmod 600 ~/.my.cnf

        Initialize schema and data:
        bash

        mysql -u testing -p banking_db < src/main/resources/schema.sql

        Ensure schema.sql includes tables, view, stored procedure, and sample data.
    Update Application Properties
    Edit src/main/resources/application.properties:
    properties

    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/banking_db
    spring.datasource.username=testing
    spring.datasource.password=heilschindler
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate
    spring.jpa.show-sql=true

    Build and Run
    bash

    mvn clean package
    mvn spring-boot:run

    The API will be available at http://localhost:8080.

Running Tests
Two bash scripts test the API endpoints:

    test_transactions_api.sh: Tests 16 transaction scenarios (GET, POST for deposits, withdrawals, transfers).
    test_account_summary_api.sh: Tests 5 account summary scenarios (GET by account/customer ID).

Prerequisites

    Application running (mvn spring-boot:run).
    MySQL configured with ~/.my.cnf.
